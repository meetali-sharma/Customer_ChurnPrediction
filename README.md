# Customer_ChurnPrediction
# Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to predict customer churn, i.e., whether a customer is likely to discontinue a service. By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques, this project aims to build a predictive model that helps businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

# Libraries Used:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
numpy: Numerical computations
matplotlib: Data visualization
seaborn: Statistical data visualization
sklearn:
→ Model building and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
→ Preprocessing (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, StandardScaler)
→ Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)

# Project Steps:

Step 1: Data Preprocessing:
        Handled missing values, removed irrelevant features, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Analyzed churn distribution and visualized relationships between customer attributes (such as age, balance, credit score, and activity status) and churn behavior using plots.

Step 3: Feature Engineering:
        Performed encoding of categorical variables, handled class imbalance if present, selected important features, and optimized the dataset for better model performance.

Step 4: Model Training and Evaluation:
        Trained multiple classification models and evaluated them using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to identify the best-     performing model.
